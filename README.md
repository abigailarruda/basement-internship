# Basement Internship

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 1. Intro

A project to test React and logic skills on internship candidates.

### Objectives

Given a counter, you'll have to display the counter itself but with some caveats:

- If the counter is a multiple of 3 it should display `Basement`
- If the counter is a multiple of 5, it should display `Internship`
- If the counter is a multiple of 3 and 5, it should display `Basement internship`

### Project

You'll be given a project with a component **`BasementInternship`** where all the logic for the app to run will be.\
What you'll have to implement:

- Button logic to increment the counter
- Button logic to reverse the counter
- Display logic with the given conditionals

### Bonus

As for bonus, you can implement a timer that will auto-increment the counter and display it with the same conditionals.\
Beware, you'll have to remember to set a limit for the counter, just to not run it infinitely.
